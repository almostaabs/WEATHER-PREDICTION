# WEATHER-PREDICTION
This project uses historical weather data to build a regression model for predicting energy consumption or related outputs. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training (e.g., Ridge Regression), and performance evaluation. Built with Python and pandas, itâ€™s a foundational ML project ideal for learning data-driven forecasting.
